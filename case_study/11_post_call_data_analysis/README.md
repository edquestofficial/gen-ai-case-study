# Post-Call Data Analysis for AI Customer Care Agents

This project implements a system for analyzing post-call data from AI-powered customer care interactions. It focuses on evaluating the performance of the AI agent in understanding and resolving customer queries through voice interaction.

## Overview

The system processes recorded audio conversations between customers and AI agents, converting them into text for detailed analysis. This analysis aims to:

* **Assess AI Agent Performance:** Determine the effectiveness of the AI agent in understanding customer needs and providing appropriate solutions.
* **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Pinpoint weaknesses in the AI agent's performance, such as misinterpretations or inadequate responses.
* **Enhance Customer Experience:** Improve the AI agent's ability to handle customer queries efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features

* **Audio Transcription:** Automated conversion of recorded voice interactions into text.
* **Query Analysis:** AI-powered analysis of the transcribed text to identify customer queries and agent responses.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Automated evaluation of the AI agent's performance based on accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction metrics.
* **Detailed Reporting:** Generation of comprehensive reports highlighting agent performance and areas for improvement.
* **Backend Storage:** Secure storage of call recordings and transcribed data for future analysis.
