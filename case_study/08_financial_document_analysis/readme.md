## Introduction

This guide aims to provide a clear roadmap for developing a bot that automates data extraction from Financial Documents. The extracted data is stored as embeddings in a Redis Vector Database, enabling efficient retrieval using RAG technology.

## Overview

The project will involve several stages, including setting up the environment, processing the documents, generating embeddings, and creating an interactive user interface. This guide is intended for developers who want to understand the process and implement it step by step.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data extraction and processing
- **Redis Vector Database**: For storing document embeddings
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application
- **HuggingFace Embedding Model**: For generating document embeddings
- **Gemini-1.5-pro Model**: For implementing RAG-based retrieval
- **Gradio**: For building the user interface

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing financial documents
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, embedding generation, and retrieval logic
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for containerizing the application
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Collect and organize financial documents in the `data/` directory.
   - Preprocess the documents to ensure they are ready for embedding generation.

2. **Environment Setup**:

   - Install Python 3.10+ and set up a virtual environment.
   - Install required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Install Docker on your machine.

3. **Redis Setup**:

   - Set up a Redis Vector Database for storing embeddings.
   - Configure Redis for optimal performance with vector data.

4. **Embedding Generation**:

   - Choose an appropriate HuggingFace Embedding Model.
   - Implement the embedding generation logic and store the embeddings in Redis.

5. **RAG Implementation**:

   - Integrate the Gemini-1.5-pro model to enable RAG-based retrieval.
   - Develop the logic for processing user queries and retrieving relevant data.

6. **User Interface**:
   - Build a Gradio interface to allow users to interact with the bot.
   - Design the interface to be user-friendly and intuitive.
7. **Containerization**:

   - Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
   - Test the Docker container to ensure the application runs smoothly.

8. **Documentation and Deployment**:
   - Document the project thoroughly, explaining each step and its purpose.
   - Prepare the project for deployment, including setting up a GitHub repository.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional models for better accuracy.
- Scale the Redis database for handling larger datasets.
- Optimize Docker configurations for different deployment environments.
