Please follow the below step:

1. Installing Libraries: The commented lines at the beginning are for installing the necessary libraries. These should be uncommented and executed if the packages are not already installed in the environment.

2. Import Statements: Necessary classes and functions are imported from llama_index and other libraries. Some imports are commented out because they are not used in the current script.

3. Loading Documents: SimpleDirectoryReader is used to load documents from the data directory. This reader loads all files in the directory for processing.

4. Setting API Key: The API key for the Gemini model is specified. This key is necessary to authenticate and use the Gemini model.

5. Setting Embedding Model: The embedding model used for generating embeddings from text is set to a specific HuggingFace model.

6. Setting Language Model: The language model used for generating answers to queries is set to the Gemini model, with the API key provided.

7. Creating Index: A VectorStoreIndex is created from the loaded documents. This index will be used for efficient querying.

8. Creating Query Engine: The query engine is created from the index. This engine will handle user queries, fetching relevant information from the index.

9. Querying the Index: The script queries the index with specific questions and prints the responses. These queries are intended to retrieve information based on the content of the loaded documents.

10. Each part of the script is commented to provide a clear understanding of what it does and how it contributes to the overall functionality.
